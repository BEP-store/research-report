## What can be learned from existing (non-software) communities?
Looking at the different communities, it can be concluded that most of the communities have one thing in common: they work because they have a goal. In the case of the intentional communities: all but the practical communities have their ideals as a goal to fulfill. The practical communities make life easier rather than fulfilling an explicit goal.
The goal of MMO-RGP communities is to make some part of the game-play possible or easier. This is because some quests can only be done in a party that forming one is a goal to achieve. Late in the game, when enemies can become exponentialy stronger, the need of trust-worthy party members becomes greater. This can be the reason and the goal to form a guild. A clear and good goal can make a guild stable and well-defined.  
Software communities often have the goal of improving the quality of the software product. While the users report bugs or elements of the program that they are unsatisfied about, the developers can improve the program using the feedback from the users. This will result in greater users-satisfaction, wich is profitable for both user and developer.

Every community that undertakes something must have a clear and relatable goal. This goal is the foundation for the stability of the community and ensures that a community is worth joining.
