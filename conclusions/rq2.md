## What can be learned from existing efforts to involve a community with software development?
In short, there are a few key factors that can be identified in succesful software development communities:
- a small core team that actively communicates about the current and desired state of the software;
- use of GitHub (git, pull-requests, issue-tracker) or a similar system;
- modular code with standartized documentation, easy set-up and tutorials;
- use both peer reviews as formal testing;
- further stimulation of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

A small core team is necessary to provide a stable basis on which the rest of the community can rely on. This team should contain members respected by the community and provide clear information about the state and future of the project. In relation to FeedbackFruits, this team can, consist of one person from FeedbackFruits and two or three persons from the community. The members from the community can change per project and at least project issuer should take a place in the team.

GitHub is a proven tool that is familiar to almost every software developer. Studies have shown that is a very effective way of communication between the community. However, when the code is difficult to understand, not properly tested or documented, or when it is difficult to set-up, the barrier for a new user to contribute is much higher. The use of modern tools and new techniques enables people to learn and intrinsically motivates people to contribute.

With the use of peer reviews not only the quality of the code is enhanced but also the motivation of the contributor. This motivation can be boosted even further by publicly acknowledging the contributors work in combination with some sort of a reward program.
