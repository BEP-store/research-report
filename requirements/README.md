# Requirements Engineering

The field of requirements engineering is a part of systems and software engineering. It involves systems modeling and the inception, identification, analysis, specification and management of requirements. However, it can be viewed in terms of two groups of activities, corresponding with the iterative and incremental nature of the process:
requirements development and requirement management {{"pandey2010effective" | cite}}. To consider these activities, first a definition of a software requirement has to be established.

## The definition of a software requirement
In the "Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge" (SWEBOK) the IEEE[^ieee] defines a software requirement as: 'a property that must be exhibited by something in order to solve some problem in the real world' {{"swebok14" | cite}}. Requirements can be imposed on the product as well as the process. An essential property of software requirements is that they are verifiable, either as an individual feature (functional requirement) or at the system level (non-functional requirement). In addition to this behavioral properties, requirements may have attributes such as a priority rating and a progression status.

## Requirements development

Discovering, analyzing, documenting and validating requirements are all part of the process of requirements development {{"pandey2010effective" | cite}}. This process is essential to defining a software architecture works as the end user expects.

## Requirements management

Throughout the software development process, a requirement may change. This change may affect other parts of the system, in turn affecting other requirements as well. Requirements management consists of activities related to the traceability and change management of requirements {{"pandey2010effective" | cite}}. An example of an activity that are related to traceability is issue tracking.

## The Twin peaks model

In order to ensure a software implementation adheres to its requirements and keeps doing so, an iterative workflow is required. The Twin Peaks model
