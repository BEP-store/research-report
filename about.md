### Bart Heemskerk
In secondary school, I was introduced to programming when I had to program a NXT Mindstorm in NXC. Now, 22 years of age and finishing the bachelor Computer Science, I am still looking for new ways to use my programming skills to help others. Having finished the minor Education at TU Delft, I will have the qualifications to teach the lower grades of secondary school when I finished my bachelor. This is also the motivation to improve my teaching skill using specialized software (that I may have made myself).  
In my spare time I like to play "Magic the Gathering", solve rubik's cubes, play on one of my ocarina's or cook.
