# Research questions
To better understand how to solve the problem, the following main research questions and several sub-questions have been formulated. These questions are rather general, but serve to split the problem into smaller pieces, which can then be broken down even further. The smaller sub-questions will give this report its structure, but won't be anwsered explicitly in the conclusion.  
The research questions from the Project Plan have been rephrased during the research, wich means that the research questions below are rephrased versions of the original questions.

How should community driven software development be structured?
- What can be learned from existing (non-software) communities?
- What current efforts exists to involve the community in the software development process?
- How are requirements established and used in software development?
- What limitations does the existing FeedbackFruits ecosystem impose on the software?

## Sub-questions

### What can be learned from existing (non-software) communities?
- What communities are there and how do they work?
- What are the requirements for a successful community-centered ecosystem?
  - What are the strengths of these communities?
  - What are the weaknesses of these communities?
- What are factors that can be utilized for software development?

### What current efforts exists to involve the community in the software development process?
- What elements are essential in community involvement?
- What techniques are currently used for community involvement?
- How can the development process be regulated with regards to time and maintainability?
- Is it possible to keep everyone engaged during the entire development process?

### How are requirements established and used in software development?
- What is the necessity of requirements?
- What are requirements based on?
- Are there standards for establishing requirements?
- Can requirements change during the software development process?

### What limitations does the existing FeedbackFruits ecosystem impose on the software?
