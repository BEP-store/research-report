# Report structure
To anwser the four main sub-questions, the report will have four sections.  
Before theories can be defined about how we can structure community contribution, there must be defined what a community is.
Because communities exist in different sizes, with different structures and on different platforms, a few of these communities will be analysed in section 1.

Software development in its current form has some methodologies on how requirements are established for a (big) software development project.
These requirements are the basis of how the software program will be build and are therefore an essential part of the software development lifecycle. In the context of this project, the requirements are build from the problem-description and thus must be correctly translated.
In section 2, a few of the method wich are used to establish requirements will be discribed.
The dynamics of the requirements, like management and implementation, will also be given a closer look.
