# Report structure
To anwser the four main research questions, the report will have four sections. The first research question zooms in on what can be learned from (non-software) communities. Before theories can be defined about what can be learned from all sorts of communities, a definition must be established of what a community is. Because communities exist in different sizes, with different structures and on different platforms, a few of these communities will be analysed in [section 1](../communities.md).

Software development in its current form has some methodologies to establish requirements for a (big) software development project.
The second research question will take a better look at the dynamics of requirements. These requirements are the basis of how the software will be built and are therefore an essential part of the software development process.
In [section 2](../requirements/README.md), a few of the methods wich are used to establish requirements will be described.
The dynamics of the requirements, like management and implementation, will also be given a closer look.

Some ways to involve the community in building software may be composed based on the previous two sections. However, this research will probably not be the only attempt to involve a software community in building software.
The third research question is therefore focussed on existing platforms where software communities are involved in one way or another in the software development process.
[Section 3](../software-ecosystems.md) will focus on the structure of the existing software communities. The techniques used by those communities and the way that the development process engages the community will also be examined.

The first three research question focus on determining the critical attributes of the problem in a general sense. However, because these attributes have to be applicable on the current FeedbackFruits-platform, that platform may pose some limitations. With research question four, the structure of the FeedbackFruits-platform will be examined, as well as the extensiblity of the platform. The result of this research question can be found in [section 4](../fbf-ecosystem.md).
