# Recommendations
No existing solutions for the problem were found. Based on the conclusions, a description is given of what an ideal solution looks like. This solution is presented in the form of a platform.

## The ideal platform
The platform converts resources, mainly in the form of time and knowledge, into an extension to the current FeedbackFruits platform. The goal of this extension should be to fulfill a particular need. A goal can be identified as the answer to finishing the phrase: "With FeedbackFruits I would like to ..". Each goal can be devided in challlenges, sub-goals that need to be met in order to meet the goal. If these challlenges are to large to be solved by one or two pioneers, then the challlenges must be devided into sub-challenges in such a way that they can be solved by one or two pioneers.

## Resources
The platform facilitates a structured process to reach a goal. On a high level, this process consists of two parts: the gathering and spending of resources. The most important resources are time and knowledge. Less important resources can include money, servers and licensed materials. Resources can be gathered by creating a hype around the goal. Once enough resources have been acquired a team of pioneers can start implementing an extenions to achieve the goal. This will result in resources being spent.

## Pioneers
Pioneers can be identified according to the resources they contribute. Pioneers can fall into one of three categories:
- Core team (time and knowledge)
- Contributors (knowledge)
- Backers (other resources)

The core team are a select group of pioneers that take the responsibility for a project. Dividing the goal into challlenges and sub-challenges is the job of the core members, thus they will provide the structure used for the software development process. Contributors can pick up one or multiple of these sub-challenges and implement the goal of those sub-challlenges. Reviewing code or designs also is a contribution to a sub-challenge. Backers are pioneers that try to improve the project without implementing or reviewing solutions for a (sub-)challlenge. This can be done with domain-specific material (like learning methods e.g.) or more generic support (like money e.g.).

## The process
There are five main factors that are essential for the development of an extension: hype, code, requirements, updates and motivation. These factors correspond to different types communication between different categories of pioneers. Hype->resources->requirements->code->(updated) product->hype.

### Hype
Hype is created by promoting the project, either on social media or other means. Anyone, pioneer or not, can create hype for a project. Creating more hype not only stimulates backers to support the project but also motivates contributors. This effectively generates resources that can be consumed in the other parts of the process.

### Requirements
Requirements are needed to structure how resources will be consumed in order to produce code. Good requirements are fundamental to a successful process, so the specification falls on the core team. The requirements need to be formulated clearly and dependencies between requirements need to be identified early on, resulting in communication dictating this part of the process.

### Code
Code is produced by the core team and the contributors as a means of achieving the goal. The requirements should be reflected in the code produced by both the core team and the contributors. For this reason, the means of communicating about the code should facilitate referencing the relevant requirements as well.

### Process update
One of the most important factors in maintaining a successful community is the ability to keep everyone engaged with the common goal. To achieve this, everyone in the community should be kept up-to-date on the current state of the project, as well as future plans. In addition to keeping the community engaged, this part of the process also bridges the current iteration with the next iteration. It ends the current iteration with a summary of the results, and provides an opportunity for hype to be created around the next iteration.
