## Ecosystems
An ecosystem can be seen as a natural form of a community. It is bound to a location where a diversity of animals and species interact with eachother{{"EcosysDef" | cite}}. Although there is no real communication, the combination of individual self-interest (the survival of their offspring or themself) creates a network of dependencies and interactions that one can interpret as a community.  
A key factor of an ecosystem is stability. In a stable ecosystem{{"EcosysSDef" | cite}}, each species acts in such a way that they directly enable or inderectly do not interfere with the survival of another species. . An ecosystem will remain stable as long as the system is able to deal with outside disturbances.
