# Requirements for a successful community-centered ecosystem

This section defines the term Software Ecosystem and its relation to a community, as well as a model for quantifying its characteristics. It also lists several philosophies about creating and maintaining a successful community. Together, these philosophies serve as a guideline towards managing an ecosystem around such a community.


## Software Ecosystems

A Software Ecosystem (SECO) is defined by {{"van2010software" | cite}} van den Berk, Jansen, & Luinenburg, 2010, to be:

A set of actors functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with the relationships among them.

## Social interaction

In {{"sundaram2012understanding" | cite}} Sundaram, Lin, De Choudhury & Kelliher, 2012, posit that social interaction plays a central role in community formation and evolution. They present multiple perspectives on the definition of a community and a method of identifying community structures within social networks.

<!-- Requirements for communities {{"sundaram2012understanding" | cite}}:
  - Face-to-face interaction (Benedict Anderson)
  - sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging, and social identity (Barry Wellman)

## Tacit knowledge

In {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}, McDermott, 2000, list 10 critical success factors in building communities of practice. He separates these factors into four challenges:

**Management Challenge**
  - Focus on topics important to the business and community members.
  - Find a well-respected community member to coordinate the community.
  - Make sure people have time and encouragement to participate.
  - Build on the core values of the organization.

**Community Challenge**
  - Get key thought leaders involved.
  - Build personal relationships among community members.
  - Develop an active passionate core group.
  - Create forums for thinking together as well as systems for sharing information.

**Technical Challenge**
  - Make it easy to contribute and access the communityâ€™s knowledge and practices.

**Personal Challenge**
  - Create real dialogue about cutting edge issues.


Tacit knowledge (Polanyi, 1958): Sharing knowledge, not documents. {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}. Using typical knowledge management methods to leverage tacit knowledge often results in information junkyards and empty libraries. To share tacit knowledge is to think together.

Communities of practice are groups of people who share information, insight, experience, and tools about an area of common interest (Wenger, 1998). Communities are held together by passionate interest and value. Familiar software reduces the friction in connecting to the community and its space.
