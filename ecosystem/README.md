# Requirements for a successful community-centered ecosystem

This section introduces the term Software Ecosystem and its relation to a community, as well as a model for quantifying its characteristics. It also lists several philosophies about creating and maintaining a successful community. Together, these philosophies serve as a guideline towards managing an ecosystem around such a community.


## Software Ecosystems

A Software Ecosystem (SECO) is defined by {{"van2010software" | cite}} van den Berk, Jansen, & Luinenburg, 2010, to be: 'A set of actors functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with the relationships among them.' A SECO consists of a central hub, a platform and niche players. In context with the subject of this research report, the platform is the FeedbackFruits platform, the niche players are its users, mostly teachers and student and the hub is the FeedbackFruits company. In this context, the problem description becomes: how can the hub stimulate niche creation in the SECO?

According to {{"van2010software" | cite}}, niche creation can be stimulated by determining the desired future state of the SECO. To do this, both the current state and the desired improvements are needed. In order for the hub to gain insight about current state of the ecosystem, the SECO Software Assesment Model can be used. It defines a broad spectrum of characteristics of the SECO that can be made quantifiable.

To gain insights about the desired improvements, some kind of knowledge management will be needed in order to aggregate the information from all of the niche players. However, due to the use of personalized learning methodologies in the FeedbackFruits platform and the broad spectrum of subject covered by niche players, a lot of this information is tacit knowledge. In {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}, McDermott, 2000, states that sharing tacit knowledge requires interaction and proceeds to provide a list of critical factors for building a community that can share such knowledge.

<!-- ## Social interaction

In {{"sundaram2012understanding" | cite}} Sundaram, Lin, De Choudhury & Kelliher, 2012, posit that social interaction plays a central role in community formation and evolution. They present multiple perspectives on the definition of a community and a method of identifying community structures within social networks. -->

  - sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging, and social identity (Barry Wellman)

## Communities of practice

Communities of practice enable person-to-person interaction, as well as engaging a whole group in advancing their field. As such, they are ideal vehicles for sharing tacit knowledge.
In {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}, McDermott, 2000, list 10 critical success factors in building communities of practice. He separates these factors into four challenges:

**Management Challenge**
  - Focus on topics important to the business and community members.
  - Find a well-respected community member to coordinate the community.
  - Make sure people have time and encouragement to participate.
  - Build on the core values of the organization.

**Community Challenge**
  - Get key thought leaders involved.
  - Build personal relationships among community members.
  - Develop an active passionate core group.
  - Create forums for thinking together as well as systems for sharing information.

**Technical Challenge**
  - Make it easy to contribute and access the communityâ€™s knowledge and practices.

**Personal Challenge**
  - Create real dialogue about cutting edge issues.

Tacit knowledge (Polanyi, 1958): Sharing knowledge, not documents. {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}. Using typical knowledge management methods to leverage tacit knowledge often results in information junkyards and empty libraries. To share tacit knowledge is to think together.

Communities of practice are groups of people who share information, insight, experience, and tools about an area of common interest (Wenger, 1998). Communities are held together by passionate interest and value. Familiar software reduces the friction in connecting to the community and its space.
