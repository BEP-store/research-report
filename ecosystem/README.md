# Requirements for a successful community-centered ecosystem

This section introduces the term Software Ecosystem and its relation to a community, as well as a model for quantifying its characteristics. It also lists several challenges in creating and maintaining a successful community.


## Software Ecosystems

A Software Ecosystem (SECO) is defined by {{"van2010software" | cite}} van den Berk, Jansen, & Luinenburg, 2010, to be: 'A set of actors functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with the relationships among them.' A SECO consists of a central hub, a platform and niche players. In context with the subject of this research report, the platform is the FeedbackFruits platform, the niche players are its users, mostly teachers and students, and the hub is the FeedbackFruits company. In this context, the problem description becomes: how can the hub stimulate niche creation in the SECO?

According to {{"van2010software" | cite}}, niche creation can be stimulated by determining the desired future state of the SECO. To do this, both the current state and the desired improvements need to be known. In order for the hub to gain insight about current state of the ecosystem, the SECO Software Assesment Model can be used. It defines a broad spectrum of characteristics of the SECO that can be made quantifiable.

To gain insights about the desired improvements, some kind of knowledge management will be needed in order to aggregate the information from all of the niche players. However, due to the use of personalized learning methodologies in the FeedbackFruits platform and the broad spectrum of subjects covered by niche players, a lot of this information is tacit knowledge. In {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}, McDermott, 2000, states that sharing tacit knowledge requires interaction and proceeds to provide a list of critical factors for building a community that can share such knowledge.

## Communities of practice

Communities of practice enable person-to-person interaction while still engaging a whole group in advancing their field. As such, they are ideal vehicles for sharing tacit knowledge.
In {{"mcdermott2000knowing" | cite}}, McDermott, 2000, list 10 critical success factors in building communities of practice. He separates these factors into four challenges:

**Management Challenge**
  - Focus on topics important to the business and community members.
  - Find a well-respected community member to coordinate the community.
  - Make sure people have time and encouragement to participate.
  - Build on the core values of the organization.

**Community Challenge**
  - Get key thought leaders involved.
  - Build personal relationships among community members.
  - Develop an active passionate core group.
  - Create forums for thinking together as well as systems for sharing information.

**Technical Challenge**
  - Make it easy to contribute and access the communityâ€™s knowledge and practices.

**Personal Challenge**
  - Create real dialogue about cutting edge issues.

These challenges are centered around very human problems, since sharing tacit knowledge is thinking together and discovering what insights of the past are relevant for the future. To make a community of practice really valuable, inclusive and vibrant, they need a human touch of nurture.
