# Existing Communities

## What techniques are currently used to involve a community with software development?
There are many projects that are build with the help of an online community. The largest projects include the development of the Linux kernel[^linuxrepo], the Apache project[^apacherepo] and the Mozilla browser[^mozillarepo]. However there are also many smaller initiatives like ??. To include the online communities during the development of such online software it is necessary to keep everyone up to date and informed about the current state of the project.
